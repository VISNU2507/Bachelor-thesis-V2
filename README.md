# Bachelor Thesis: ECG-Derived Respiratory Monitoring

This repository supports the thesis project:

**Transforming Cardiac Signals into Respiratory Insights**  
*Bachelor Thesis in Biomedical Engineering, DTU Health Tech (2025)*  
**Author:** Visnukaran Kirubakaran

---

## 🩺 Project Overview

This project is part of the **DIAMONDS** initiative — a novel system for **non-invasive, continuous respiratory monitoring** using **ECG signals extracted from dEMG recordings**.

The full processing pipeline transforms raw diaphragm EMG signals into respiratory insights via:

- R-peak detection
- EDR (ECG-Derived Respiration) signal computation
- Breath segmentation and classification
